# Zero-Shot-Scene-Affordance-Detection-Using-Semantic-Embeddings-for-Open-World-Perception
This work proposes a zero-shot vision–language-based approach for drivable affordance detection. Using semantic embeddings and prompt-driven segmentation, it localizes navigable road regions without training and remains robust under diverse and adverse conditions.
